hi, i used hydromt & wflow (Deltares product) a lot in my work as a Junior Modeller (mostly hydrological)\
i know they are very easy to use already but sometimes there are niche tasks that i still need to do manually, such as:
<ul>
-  converting rainfall data (without spatial data) into netcdf<br>
-  estimating low flow of a catchment<br>
-  plotting multiple years of rainfall to find out which one is the closest to average<br>
-  etc.<br>
</ul>
