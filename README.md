hi, i used hydromt & wflow (Deltares product) a lot in my work as a Junior Modeller (mostly hydrological). /n
i know they are very easy to use already but sometimes there are niche tasks that i still need to do manually, such as: /n
* converting rainfall data (without spatial data) into netcdf
* estimating low flow of a catchment
* plotting multiple years of rainfall to find out which one is the closest to average
* etc. /n
please feel free to take a look
